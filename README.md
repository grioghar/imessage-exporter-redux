A cross-platform **iMessage & SMS archival suite** built in C++17. It reads Apple's
Messages database **read-only** and produces beautiful, portable exports — from a
native desktop app for everyday users all the way to an embeddable C library for iOS
developers.

## What it does

- **Exports** your iMessage, SMS, and RCS conversation history to **HTML**,
  **PDF**, **JSON**, **TXT**, or **Android SMS XML**.
- **Beautifies** HTML exports: iOS-style message bubbles, contact photos, group
  chat headers, inline images & video, YouTube / Spotify embeds (playable),
  Open Graph rich link previews, and a choice of **five visual themes**.
- **Connects** to your contacts: macOS AddressBook, iCloud CardDAV,
  **Google Contacts** (OAuth), or any vCard `.vcf` — with an optional persistent
  store that survives updates.
- **Uploads** finished exports directly to **Google Drive**.
- **Reads** from your Mac's live database or an iTunes/Finder **device backup**
  (no iCloud required for messages).
- **Analyses** your history with an optional `00-statistics.html` cover page:
  hourly/weekly charts, top texters, streaks, and fun facts.
- **Filters** by date range, or by choosing specific people from a smart list
  that can sort, search, and hide contacts you haven't heard from in ages.

### Package managers

```bash
# Homebrew (macOS / Linux) — CLI
brew tap grioghar/tap https://github.com/grioghar/homebrew-tap
brew install grioghar/tap/imessage-exporter

# Homebrew — desktop GUI (.app)
brew install --cask grioghar/tap/imessage-exporter-app   # add --no-quarantine while unsigned

# Chocolatey (Windows)
choco install imessage-exporter
```

---

## Desktop app quick start

1. Launch **iMessage Exporter** (`.app` on macOS, Start menu on Windows).
2. **Source** — leave on "Auto-detect on this Mac" if Messages is synced here,
   or pick a database file / device backup.
3. **Contacts** — connect iCloud or Google Contacts for name resolution, or skip
   (handles show as phone numbers / emails).
4. **Output** — choose a folder, a format, and optionally a theme.
5. Click **Export**. Progress appears in the status bar; the log pane shows
   detail. Pause or Stop at any time.

The app checks for updates automatically (Help → "Automatically check for
updates") and installs them with one click.

---

## CLI quick start

```bash
# Export every conversation as styled HTML
./imessage-exporter --format html --output ./export

# Plain text from a specific database
./imessage-exporter --db ./chat.db --format txt --output ./export

# Date range, with contact-name resolution and attachments copied in
./imessage-exporter --format html --since 2023-01-01 --until 2023-12-31 \
    --contacts --copy-attachments --output ./export

# From an iTunes/Finder backup (with the device's own contacts)
./imessage-exporter --list-backups
./imessage-exporter --backup latest --contacts --format html --output ./export

# Android-compatible XML (SMS Backup & Restore format)
./imessage-exporter --format android --output ./export

# Export with a statistics cover page and LCARS theme
./imessage-exporter --format html --theme lcars --stats --output ./export

# List conversations without exporting
./imessage-exporter --list-chats
```

## Where the messages come from

iMessage is end-to-end encrypted and Apple has no export API, so the tool
reads an existing database rather than talking to iCloud.

**Option 1 — Mac's local database (default).** If your Mac has Messages signed in
with iCloud sync enabled, your full history lives at
`~/Library/Messages/chat.db`. The CLI needs **Full Disk Access**
(System Settings → Privacy & Security → Full Disk Access). The desktop app
guides you through granting it.

**Option 2 — Device backup.** Make a local **unencrypted** backup in Finder or
iTunes (turn off "Encrypt local backup" first). Then use `--backup latest` (or
pick the backup in the app). Contacts from the device are extracted automatically
when `--contacts` is set.

---

## Export formats

| Format | What you get |
|---|---|
| **HTML** | One styled `.html` per conversation (or `--combined`). iOS-style bubbles, contact photos, inline media, YouTube / Spotify embeds, Open Graph cards, 5 themes. |
| **PDF** | Same as HTML — rendered to PDF with page-break-safe layout (images never split). |
| **JSON** | Structured data: every message, attachment path, and participant with full metadata. |
| **TXT** | Plain-text transcript, one file per conversation. |
| **Android XML** | [SMS Backup & Restore](https://synctech.com.au/sms-backup-restore/) format — import directly onto an Android device. |

---

## HTML themes

Choose with `--theme NAME` (CLI) or the theme menu in the desktop app:

| Theme | Description |
|---|---|
| `ios` | Clean, familiar iOS Messages look (default). |
| `lcars` | Star Trek LCARS interface palette. |
| `matrix` | Green-on-black terminal aesthetic. |
| `dot-matrix` | Retro dot-matrix printer output. |
| `atari` | ATARI 8-bit colour scheme. |

Adding a new theme is a single CSS file — no engine changes needed.

---

## Contacts & cloud

### iCloud Contacts
Click **Import iCloud Contacts** in the desktop app and enter your Apple ID
app-specific password (create one at [account.apple.com](https://account.apple.com)
→ Sign-In and Security → App-Specific Passwords). Your normal Apple password is
never used. Contacts are fetched via CardDAV and saved locally for offline use.

### Google Contacts & Google Drive
See [**docs/GOOGLE.md**](docs/GOOGLE.md) for a step-by-step guide with direct
links to each Google Cloud Console page. Once set up:

- **Google Contacts** resolves names from your Google address book.
- **Google Drive** uploads the finished export folder automatically after each run.

Both credentials are stored encrypted using the platform keychain (macOS
Keychain, Windows Credential Manager, Linux Secret Service).

---

## Statistics cover page

Pass `--stats` (CLI) or check the **Statistics** box in the desktop app to get a
standalone `00-statistics.html` alongside your export:

- Messages by **hour of day** and **day of week** (CSS bar charts).
- **Top texters** ranked by volume.
- Date range, total counts, sent vs. received, attachment tallies.
- Playful **"Fun facts"** — longest message, most-used emoji, busiest day, and more.

---

## Building from source

Requires **CMake ≥ 3.16** and a C++17 compiler.

```bash
cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build build
ctest --test-dir build      # 142 unit tests, no SQLite needed
```

**Platform notes:**

- **macOS** — SQLite3 ships with the system; found automatically.
- **Linux** — install `libsqlite3-dev`; without it, only the core library and
  tests build (CMake warns but does not error).
- **Windows** — SQLite is fetched via vcpkg in CI. For a local build, install
  vcpkg and `vcpkg install sqlite3:x64-windows`.
- **Desktop GUI** — requires **Qt 6** (`qt6-base-dev` on Debian/Ubuntu; official
  Qt installer on macOS/Windows). If Qt is not found, CMake builds only the CLI.

The CLI binary is at `build/imessage-exporter`; the GUI at
`build/imessage-exporter-gui` (or `"iMessage Exporter.app"` on macOS).

---

## Docker (Linux CLI)

```bash
docker build -t imessage-exporter .

# Mount your data directory; results appear inside it
docker run --rm -v "$PWD:/data" imessage-exporter \
    --db /data/chat.db --format html --output /data/export \
    --contacts-db /data/contacts.vcf
```

The container image is also pushed to
[`ghcr.io/grioghar/imessage-exporter-redux`](https://github.com/grioghar/imessage-exporter-redux/pkgs/container/imessage-exporter-redux)
on every `v*` release tag.

## iOS / embedding

A pure-C bridge ([`include/imsg/imsg_bridge.h`](include/imsg/imsg_bridge.h)) and
a SwiftPM package ([`Package.swift`](Package.swift)) let you embed the engine in
any app. An example SwiftUI iOS app lives in [`ios/`](ios/).

> iOS sandboxing prevents reading the live Messages database. The app must import
> a `chat.db` the user supplies (e.g. from a backup). See
> [**docs/IOS.md**](docs/IOS.md) for details.

The engine is split into layers so that the tricky parsing/formatting logic stays
fully testable without SQLite:

- **`imsg_core`** — models, time conversion, `attributedBody` decoder, exporters,
  themes, stats. Zero external dependencies; used by the unit tests directly.
- **`imsg_db`** — adds SQLite: database reader, contact loader, backup extractor,
  export job orchestration.
- **`imsg_mobile`** — pure-C ABI over `imsg_db`, consumed by iOS / SwiftPM.
- **`imessage-exporter`** — thin CLI wrapper.
- **`imessage-exporter-gui`** — Qt 6 desktop app; the only layer that does
  network I/O (contacts sync, Drive upload, link previews, updates).

---

## Two technical quirks worth knowing

**1. Timestamps.** `message.date` is seconds since 2001-01-01 UTC — but
nanoseconds on macOS 10.13+. The engine auto-detects by magnitude (≥ 10¹¹ →
nanoseconds) and converts correctly for both old and new databases.

**2. `attributedBody`.** Modern macOS frequently leaves `message.text` as `NULL`
and stores the visible text in an `attributedBody` BLOB — an `NSAttributedString`
serialized with the legacy NeXTSTEP typedstream format. The engine decodes the
UTF-8 payload from the typedstream, validates it, strips invisible Unicode
control characters, and falls back gracefully on unexpected layouts.

See [`docs/SCHEMA.md`](docs/SCHEMA.md) for the full schema reference.

## Roadmap

The 0.6.0-0.6.1 cycle shipped themes, statistics, inactive-contact filtering,
per-conversation stats, an interactive timeline page, SMS/RCS green-text style,
and the granular Statistics and Timeline preferences tabs. Below is the planned
scope for 0.7.0:

- **AI relationship analysis engine.** Analyse the patterns and dynamics within
  conversations — sentiment arcs, topic clustering, response-time graphs, dominant
  speakers, relationship strength over time, and statistical correlations between
  contacts and time/date/context. Produces a rich analytical report alongside the
  export.
- **AI service OAuth + message summarisation.** An OAuth sign-in flow for major
  AI providers (OpenAI/ChatGPT, Anthropic/Claude, Google Gemini, and others).
  Once authenticated, selected conversations or date ranges can be submitted for
  AI-generated summary, sentiment analysis, or Q&A. Credentials are stored
  encrypted in the platform keychain alongside existing Google credentials.
- **Reply engine (HTML → iMessage).** A way to reply to conversations directly
  from the exported HTML page. Each message bubble gains a reply affordance that
  opens a compose area; sending routes through the macOS Messages URL scheme
  (or AppleScript on macOS) to deliver the reply via iMessage without leaving
  the export.
- **Low-footprint backup streaming.** For large archives (hundreds of GB on an
  external drive or iPhone backup), process and export one conversation at a time
  directly from the backup without ever extracting the full `sms.db` to the local
  machine. The export engine already streams one conversation at a time in memory;
  this extends that to the source side — read a conversation's rows from the
  backup's SQLite blob, write the HTML, move on. Lets you export a 250 GB message
  history to an external drive without the laptop ever holding more than one
  conversation's worth of data.
- **Location context on the timeline.** Correlate message timestamps with location
  records from three sources the tool can already reach: the macOS Photos library
  (Photos.sqlite, same Full Disk Access permission already required), the
  com.apple.routined/Local.sqlite significant-location database inside an iPhone
  backup (which the tool already parses), and a Google Takeout Records.json export
  (parseable with the Google OAuth infrastructure already built). The result: each
  message on the timeline can optionally show where you were when you sent it.
  Waze and the real-time Google Maps Timeline API have no public endpoint; the
  Takeout JSON is the only Google export path.
